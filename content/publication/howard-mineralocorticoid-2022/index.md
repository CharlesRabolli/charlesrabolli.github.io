abstract: Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) slow cardiomyopathy in patients
  with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and improve skeletal muscle pathology and
  function in dystrophic mice. However, glucocorticoids, known antiinflammatory drugs,
  remain a standard of care for DMD, despite substantial side effects. Exact mechanisms
  underlying mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling contribution to dystrophy are
  unknown. Whether MRAs affect inflammation in dystrophic muscles and how they compare
  with glucocorticoids is unclear. The MRA spironolactone and glucocorticoid prednisolone
  were each administered for 1 week to dystrophic mdx mice during peak skeletal muscle
  necrosis to compare effects on inflammation. Both drugs reduced cytokine levels
  in mdx quadriceps, but prednisolone elevated diaphragm cytokines. Spironolactone
  did not alter myeloid populations in mdx quadriceps or diaphragms, but prednisolone
  increased F4/80hi macrophages. Both spironolactone and prednisolone reduced inflammatory
  gene expression in myeloid cells sorted from mdx quadriceps, while prednisolone
  additionally perturbed cell cycle genes. Spironolactone also repressed myeloid expression
  of the gene encoding fibronectin, while prednisolone increased its expression. Overall,
  spironolactone exhibits antiinflammatory properties without altering leukocyte distribution
  within skeletal muscles, while prednisolone suppresses quadriceps cytokines but
  increases diaphragm cytokines and pathology. Antiinflammatory properties of MRAs
  and different limb and respiratory muscle responses to glucocorticoids should be
  considered when optimizing treatments for patients with DMD.
