abstract: 'Elastin-like peptides (ELPs) are derivatives of tropoelastin with a unique
  property that allows them to stay soluble below a certain critical temperature but
  reversibly form aggregates above that temperature. Since they are derived from tropoelastin,
  ELPs are biocompatible, non-toxic, and non-immunogenic. The unique properties of
  ELPs have made them a desirable class of fusion tags used in several biomedical
  applications including targeted drug delivery and enhancing the half-life of protein
  drugs. The most significant property of an ELP is that when fused to other proteins,
  the phase transition property of the ELP is maintained, and the target protein can
  be purified using the thermally driven property of the ELP. The ELP tag purification
  process is simple and inexpensive, and involves cycling the protein above and below
  the transition temperature of the ELP fusion followed by centrifugation to obtain
  the desired protein, without any need for chromatography. Consequently, using ELPs
  as a purification tag should be potentially interesting to biopharmaceutical companies
  who spend a significant percentage of their manufacturing costs on expensive protein
  purification techniques such as chromatography and filtration. However, ELP tags
  have not yet been used for commercial protein purification due to some challenges
  of translating this technique, which has been demonstrated mostly in academic laboratories,
  to a biotechnology manufacturing environment. The article first reviews the state-of-the-art
  in protein \"ELPylation,\" and discusses some applications which have benefitted
  from using ELP as a fusion tag. Then, the article discusses the main advantages
  of using ELP as a purification tag, and evaluates the remaining hurdles for its
  implementation in industrial protein production. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2016;113: 1617-1627.
