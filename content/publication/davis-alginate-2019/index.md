abstract: 'PURPOSE: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are used to treat various inflammatory
  conditions. In parallel, to mitigate pain associated with inflammation, analgesics
  or opioids are prescribed, often with significant side effects. Local anesthetics
  (LAs) offer a promising alternative to these medications. However, their short duration
  and negative effects on anti-inflammatory MSCs have limited their therapeutic effectiveness.
  To mitigate these negative effects and to move toward developing a cotherapy, we
  engineered a sustained release bupivacaine alginate-liposomal construct that enables
  up to 4 days of LA release. By encapsulating MSC in alginate (eMSC), we demonstrate
  that we can further increase drug concentration to clinically relevant levels, without
  compromising eMSC viability or anti-inflammatory function. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
  MSCs were freely cultured or encapsulated in alginate microspheres ± TNFα/IFN-γ
  and were left untreated or dosed with bolus, liposomal, or construct bupivacaine.
  After 24, 48, and 96 hours, the profiles were assessed to quantify secretory function
  associated with LA-MSC interactions. To approximate LA exposure over time, a MATLAB
  model was generated. RESULTS: eMSCs secrete similar levels of IL-6 and prostaglandin
  E2 (PGE2) regardless of LA modality, whereas free MSCs secrete larger amounts of
  IL-6 and lower amounts of anti-inflammatory PGE2. Modeling the system indicated
  that higher doses of LA can be used in conjunction with eMSC while retaining eMSC
  viability and function. In general, eMSC treated with higher doses of LA secreted
  similar or higher levels of immunomodulatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: eMSCs, but not
  free MSC, are protected from LA, regardless of LA modality. Increasing the LA concentration
  may promote longer and stronger pain mitigation while the protected eMSCs secrete
  similar, if not higher, immunomodulatory cytokine levels. Therefore, we have developed
  an approach, using eMSC and the LA construct that can potentially be used to reduce
  pain as well as improve MSC anti-inflammatory function.'
