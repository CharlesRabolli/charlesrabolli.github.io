abstract: The YTH-domain family (YTHDF) of RNA binding proteins can control gene expression
  at the post-transcriptional level by regulating mRNAs with N6-methyladenosine (m6A)
  modifications. Despite the established importance of m6A in the heart, the cardiac
  role of specific m6A-binding proteins remains unclear. Here, we characterized the
  function of YTHDF1 in cardiomyocytes using a newly generated cardiac-restricted
  mouse model. Deletion of YTHDF1 in adult cardiomyocytes led to hypertrophy, fibrosis,
  and dysfunction. Using mass spectrometry, we identified the necessity of YTHDF1
  for the expression of cardiomyocyte membrane raft proteins. Specifically, YTHDF1
  bound to m6A-modified Caveolin 1 (Cav1) mRNA and favored its translation. We further
  demonstrated that YTHDF1 regulates downstream ERK signaling. Altogether, our findings
  highlight a novel role for YTHDF1 as a post-transcriptional regulator of caveolar
  proteins which is necessary for the maintenance of cardiac function.
