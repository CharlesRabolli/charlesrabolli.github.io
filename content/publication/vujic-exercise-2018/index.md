abstract: Loss of cardiomyocytes is a major cause of heart failure, and while the
  adult heart has a limited capacity for cardiomyogenesis, little is known about what
  regulates this ability or whether it can be effectively harnessed. Here we show
  that 8 weeks of running exercise increase birth of new cardiomyocytes in adult mice
  (~4.6-fold). New cardiomyocytes are identified based on incorporation of 15N-thymidine
  by multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry (MIMS) and on being mononucleate/diploid.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that exercise after myocardial infarction induces a
  robust cardiomyogenic response in an extended border zone of the infarcted area.
  Inhibition of miR-222, a microRNA increased by exercise in both animal models and
  humans, completely blocks the cardiomyogenic exercise response. These findings demonstrate
  that cardiomyogenesis can be activated by exercise in the normal and injured adult
  mouse heart and suggest that stimulation of endogenous cardiomyocyte generation
  could contribute to the benefits of exercise.
