abstract: The regulation of proteostasis is fundamental for maintenance of muscle
  mass and function. Activation of the TGF-β pathway drives wasting and premature
  aging by favoring the proteasomal degradation of structural muscle proteins. Yet,
  how this critical post-translational mechanism is kept in check to preserve muscle
  health remains unclear. Here, we reveal the molecular link between the post-transcriptional
  regulation of m6A-modified mRNA and the modulation of SMAD-dependent TGF-β signaling.
  We show that the m6A-binding protein YTHDF2 is essential to determining postnatal
  muscle size. Indeed, muscle-specific genetic deletion of YTHDF2 impairs skeletal
  muscle growth and abrogates the response to hypertrophic stimuli. We report that
  YTHDF2 controls the mRNA stability of the ubiquitin ligase ASB2 with consequences
  on anti-growth gene program activation through SMAD3. Our study identifies a post-transcriptional
  to post-translational mechanism for the coordination of gene expression in muscle.
