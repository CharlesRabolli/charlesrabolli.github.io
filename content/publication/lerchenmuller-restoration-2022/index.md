abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The human heart has limited capacity to generate new cardiomyocytes
  and this capacity declines with age. Because loss of cardiomyocytes may contribute
  to heart failure, it is crucial to explore stimuli of endogenous cardiac regeneration
  to favorably shift the balance between loss of cardiomyocytes and the birth of new
  cardiomyocytes in the aged heart. We have previously shown that cardiomyogenesis
  can be activated by exercise in the young adult mouse heart. Whether exercise also
  induces cardiomyogenesis in aged hearts, however, is still unknown. Here, we aim
  to investigate the effect of exercise on the generation of new cardiomyocytes in
  the aged heart. METHODS: Aged (20-month-old) mice were subjected to an 8-week voluntary
  running protocol, and age-matched sedentary animals served as controls. Cardiomyogenesis
  in aged hearts was assessed on the basis of 15N-thymidine incorporation and multi-isotope
  imaging mass spectrometry. We analyzed 1793 cardiomyocytes from 5 aged sedentary
  mice and compared these with 2002 cardiomyocytes from 5 aged exercised mice, followed
  by advanced histology and imaging to account for ploidy and nucleation status of
  the cell. RNA sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analyses were performed to
  investigate transcriptional changes induced by exercise specifically in aged hearts
  in comparison with young hearts. RESULTS: Cardiomyogenesis was observed at a significantly
  higher frequency in exercised compared with sedentary aged hearts on the basis of
  the detection of mononucleated/diploid 15N-thymidine-labeled cardiomyocytes. No
  mononucleated/diploid 15N-thymidine-labeled cardiomyocyte was detected in sedentary
  aged mice. The annual rate of mononucleated/diploid 15N-thymidine-labeled cardiomyocytes
  in aged exercised mice was 2.3% per year. This compares with our previously reported
  annual rate of 7.5% in young exercised mice and 1.63% in young sedentary mice. Transcriptional
  profiling of young and aged exercised murine hearts and their sedentary controls
  revealed that exercise induces pathways related to circadian rhythm, irrespective
  of age. One known oscillating transcript, however, that was exclusively upregulated
  in aged exercised hearts, was isoform 1.4 of regulator of calcineurin, whose regulation
  and functional role were explored further. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that
  voluntary running in part restores cardiomyogenesis in aged mice and suggest that
  pathways associated with circadian rhythm may play a role in physiologically stimulated
  cardiomyogenesis.'
