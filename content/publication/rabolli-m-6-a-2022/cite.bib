 abstract = {Post-transcriptional modifications encompass a large group of RNA alterations that control gene expression. Methylation of the N6-Adenosine (m6A) of mRNA is a prevalent modification which alters the life cycle of transcripts. The roles that m6A play in regulating cardiac homeostasis and injury response are an active area of investigation, but it is clear that this chemical modification is a critical controller of fibroblast to myofibroblast transition, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and division, and the structure and function of the extracellular matrix. Here we discuss the latest findings of m6A in cardiac muscle and matrix.},
