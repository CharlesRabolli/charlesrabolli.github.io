abstract: Post-transcriptional modifications encompass a large group of RNA alterations
  that control gene expression. Methylation of the N6-Adenosine (m6A) of mRNA is a
  prevalent modification which alters the life cycle of transcripts. The roles that
  m6A play in regulating cardiac homeostasis and injury response are an active area
  of investigation, but it is clear that this chemical modification is a critical
  controller of fibroblast to myofibroblast transition, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy
  and division, and the structure and function of the extracellular matrix. Here we
  discuss the latest findings of m6A in cardiac muscle and matrix.
