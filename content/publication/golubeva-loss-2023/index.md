abstract: How post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, such as through
  N6-methyladenosine (m6A) messenger RNA methylation, impacts heart function is not
  well understood. We found that loss of the m6A binding protein YTHDF2 in cardiomyocytes
  of adult mice drove cardiac dysfunction. By proteomics, we found myocardial zonula
  adherens protein (MYZAP) within the top up-regulated proteins in knockout cardiomyocytes.
  We further demonstrated that YTHDF2 binds m6A-modified Myzap messenger RNA and controls
  its stability. Cardiac overexpression of MYZAP has been associated with cardiomyopathy.
  Thus, our findings provide an important new mechanism for the YTHDF2-dependent regulation
  of this target and therein its novel role in the maintenance of cardiac homeostasis.
