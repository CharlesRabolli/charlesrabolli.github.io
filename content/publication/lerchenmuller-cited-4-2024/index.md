abstract: Cardiac signaling pathways functionally important in the heart's response
  to exercise often protect the heart against pathological stress, potentially providing
  novel therapeutic targets. However, it is important to determine which of these
  pathways can be feasibly targeted in vivo. Transgenic overexpression of exercise-induced
  CITED4 has been shown to protect against adverse remodeling after ischemia/reperfusion
  injury (IRI). Here we investigated whether somatic gene transfer of CITED4 in a
  clinically relevant time frame could promote recovery after IRI. Cardiac CITED4
  gene delivery via intravenous AAV9 injections in wild type mice led to an approximately
  3-fold increase in cardiac CITED4 expression. After 4 weeks, CITED4-treated animals
  developed physiological cardiac hypertrophy without adverse remodeling. In IRI,
  delivery of AAV9-CITED4 after reperfusion resulted in a 6-fold increase in CITED4
  expression 1 week after surgery, as well as decreased apoptosis, fibrosis, and inflammatory
  markers, culminating in a smaller scar and improved cardiac function 8 weeks after
  IRI, compared with control mice receiving AAV9-GFP. Somatic gene transfer of CITED4
  induced a phenotype suggestive of physiological cardiac growth and mitigated adverse
  remodeling after ischemic injury. These studies support the feasibility of CITED4
  gene therapy delivered in a clinically relevant time frame to mitigate adverse ventricular
  remodeling after ischemic injury.
