abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease, with limited
  treatment options, characterized by inflammation and matrix degradation, and resulting
  in severe pain or disability. Progressive inflammatory interaction among key cell
  types, including chondrocytes and macrophages, leads to a cascade of intra- and
  inter-cellular events which culminate in OA induction. In order to investigate these
  interactions, we developed a multi-cellular in vitro OA model, to characterize OA
  progression, and identify and evaluate potential OA therapeutics in response to
  mediators representing graded levels of inflammatory severity. METHODS: We compared
  macrophages, chondrocytes and their co-culture responses to \"low\" Interleukin-1
  (IL-1) or \"high\" IL-1/tumor necrosis factor (IL-1/TNF) levels of inflammation.
  We also investigated response changes following the administration of dexamethasone
  (DEX) or mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) treatment via a combination of gene expression
  and secretory changes, reflecting not only inflammation, but also chondrocyte function.
  RESULTS: Inflamed chondrocytes presented an osteoarthritic-like phenotype characterized
  by high gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, up-regulation
  of ECM degrading proteases, and down-regulation of chondrogenic genes. Our results
  indicate that while MSC treatment attenuates macrophage inflammation directly, it
  does not reduce chondrocyte inflammatory responses, unless macrophages are present
  as well. DEX however, can directly attenuate chondrocyte inflammation. CONCLUSIONS:
  Our results highlight the importance of considering multi-cellular interactions
  when studying complex systems such as the articular joint. In addition, our approach,
  using a panel of both inflammatory and chondrocyte functional genes, provides a
  more comprehensive approach to investigate disease biomarkers, and responses to
  treatment.'
